</div>


<p class="drop-capy1">A<span class="smcap">bout</span> the year 1450,
Gutenberg was engaged in printing his first book from movable types.
No method of taking the impressions simpler than that employed by him
can be imagined, unless it be with a “buffer,” or by means of a brush
rubbed over the paper laid upon the “form” of type, after the manner
of the Chinese in printing from engraved blocks. His printing press
consisted of two upright timbers, with cross pieces of wood to stay
them together at the top and bottom. There were also intermediate
cross timbers, one of which supported the flat “bed” upon which the
type was placed, and through another a wooden screw passed, its
lower point resting on the centre of a wooden “platen,” which was
thus screwed down upon the type. After inking the form with a ball
of leather stuffed with wool, the printer spread the paper over it,
laying a piece of blanket upon the paper to soften the impression
of the platen and remove inequalities. This was the machine which
Gutenberg used. The mechanical principle embodied in it was found in
the old cheese and linen presses ordinarily seen in the houses of
medieval times.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p006.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="captionx">THE EARLIEST FORM OF PRINTING PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>Were Gutenberg called upon to print his Bible to-day he would find
virtually the same type ready for his purpose as that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>

made by him, no change having taken place in its general
conformation; but he would be bewildered in the maze of printing
machinery of the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The simple form of wooden press, worked with a screw by means of a
movable bar, continued in use for about one hundred and fifty years,
or until the early part of the seventeenth century, without any
material change. The forms of type were placed upon the same wooden
and sometimes stone beds, incased in frames called “coffins,” moved
in and out laboriously by hand, and after each impression the platen
had to be screwed up with the bar so that the paper which had been
printed upon it might be removed and hung up to dry.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p007.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="captionx">THE BLAEW PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>The first recorded improvements in this press were made by
William Jensen Blaew, a printer of Amsterdam, some time about 1620.
They consisted in passing the spindle of the screw through a square
block which was guided in the wooden frame, and from this block the
platen was suspended by wires or cords; the block, or box, preventing
any twist in the platen, and insuring a more equal motion to the
screw. He also placed a device upon the press for rolling in and out
the bed, and added a new form of iron hand lever for turning the
screw. Blaew’s press was introduced into England, and used there as
well as on the continent, being substantially the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>

same as that Benjamin Franklin worked upon as a journeyman in London,
early in the last century.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p008.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="captionx">STANHOPE PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>Little further improvement was made in the printing press before
the year 1798, when the Earl of Stanhope caused one to be made,
the frame of which, instead of being of wood, was one piece of
cast-iron. A necessity had arisen for greater power in giving the
impression, especially in the printing of woodcuts, and the tendency
was naturally toward larger forms of type, requiring greater exertion
on the part of the printer; the labor in working one of the old
screw presses was about equal to that of the plowman in the field.
The Earl of Stanhope reserved the screw, but caused to be added a
combination of levers to assist the pressman in gaining greater
power, when giving the impression, with less expenditure of energy.
These machines were very heavy and extremely cumbersome. They were
the first iron printing presses ever constructed, and came into
use to some extent. The printers, seizing upon this new idea of a
combination of levers to increase the power, were induced to place
them upon their wooden presses, the improvement resulting generally
in the destruction of the latter, which were not adapted to stand
the strain. The iron platen employed by the Earl of Stanhope had,
however, previously been used upon the wooden presses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

  <div class="captionx">CLYMER’S COLUMBIAN PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>The next practical improvement was made by George Clymer of
Philadelphia, who, about 1816, devised an iron machine, entirely
dispensing with a screw. A long, heavy cast-iron lever was placed
over the platen, one end attached to one of the uprights of the
cast-iron frame, and the other susceptible of being raised and
lowered by a combination of smaller levers, worked by the pressman
after the manner of the ordinary hand press. The impression was given
and the platen raised and lowered by a spindle, or pin, attached to
the centre of the large cross lever at the top, this being properly
balanced to facilitate its being raised with greater ease. Mr. Clymer
carried his invention to England, where it was introduced to some
extent and was known as the “Columbian” press.</p>

  <div class="captionx">PETER SMITH HAND PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>In England there were iron hand presses made by Rutheven, by Brown
and by others, all, more or less, improvements upon the Stanhope.</p>

<p>In 1822 Peter Smith, an American, connected with the firm of
R. Hoe &amp; Co. in New York, devised a machine which was in many
respects superior to any up to that time. The frame was of cast-iron,
and in place of the screw with levers, he substituted a toggle joint,
at once simple and effective.</p>

<p>In 1827, however, Samuel Rust of New York, perfected an invention
which was a great improvement on the Smith press. The frame, instead
of being all of cast-iron, had the uprights at the sides hollowed
for the admission of wrought-iron bars, which were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>

securely riveted at the top and bottom of the casting. This gave
not only additional strength, but greatly diminished the amount of
metal used in construction. This patent was purchased by R. Hoe
&amp; Co., who improved upon it, and proceeded with the manufacture
of the presses, although the “Smith” continued to be used to some
extent. The new invention was known as the “Washington” press, and
in principle and construction has never been surpassed by any hand
printing machine. They were manufactured in great numbers, and
continue to be manufactured and sold at the present time for taking
fine proofs, although the universal adoption of the cylinder press
has almost entirely superseded them for other printing. The number
made and sold by Hoe &amp; Co. alone, a majority of which are now in
use, is over six thousand. They have been sent all over the world.
This style of press is made in seven sizes.</p>

<p>The following is a description of this press: The bed slides on

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>

a track and is run in and out from under the platen by turning a
crank which has belts attached to a pulley upon its shaft. The
impression of the platen is given by means of a curved lever acting
on a toggle joint, and the platen is lifted by springs on either
side. Attached to the bed is a “tympan” frame covered with cloth,
and standing inclined, to receive the sheet to be printed. Another
frame, called the “frisket,” is attached to the tympan, and covered
with a sheet of paper, having the parts which otherwise would be
printed upon cut away, so as to prevent the “chase” and “furniture”
from blacking or soiling the sheet. The frisket is turned down over
the sheet and tympan and all are folded down when the impression
is taken. Automatic inking rollers were attached to this machine,
operated by a weight raised by the pull of the pressman, the descent
of the weight drawing the rollers over the type and returning them to
the inking cylinder while the pressman placed another sheet upon the
tympan. Still further improvements in this inking apparatus were made
and patented by Hoe &amp; Co., in which the distribution of the ink
on the rollers was effected by means of an apparatus driven by steam
power and which also caused the inking rollers to move forward over
the type at the will of the pressman.</p>

  <div class="captionx">TREADWELL’S WOODEN-FRAME BED AND PLATEN POWER PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>The bed and platen system of printing was, up to the middle of
the nineteenth century, the favorite method of printing fine books
and cuts. The first “power” or steam press upon this principle

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
 was made by
Daniel Treadwell, of Boston, in 1822. The frames were of wood, and
it does not appear that more than three or four of these were ever
constructed. The best machines of this description were those devised
and patented by Isaac Adams, of Boston, in 1830 and 1836, and by Otis
Tufts, of the same place, in 1834. They were first made with wooden
and afterward with iron frames. In 1858 Adams’s business became the
property of Hoe &amp; Co., who continued to manufacture the machines
with added improvements. In all more than a thousand, in no less than
fifty-seven sizes, were sold for use in the United States, some being
sent to other countries. In these machines, the type is placed upon
an iron bed, after the usual manner of the hand press, and this bed
is raised and lowered by straightening and bending a toggle joint by
means of a cam,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>

thus giving the impression upon the iron platen fixed above it, and
firmly held in position by upright iron rods secured to the bottom
bar, a strong cross-piece, at the base of the machine. The ink
fountain is at one end of the press; the inking rollers travel twice
over the form, in a movable frisket frame, while the bed is down; the
paper is taken in by grippers on the frisket and carried over the
form, when the bed rises and the impression is given; and finally
the sheets pass forward from the frisket by tapes to a sheet flier,
which delivers them on the fly board. One thousand sheets per hour is
the maximum speed of the larger sizes of the Adams press. Although
many of these machines were made and great numbers are still used,
and notwithstanding the fact that it was thought by many experienced
printers that fine book and cut work could be done in no other way
than by flat pressure, this system of printing has given place to
that of the cylinder press.</p>

<p>The idea of printing from plates or forms carried upon a flat
bed beneath a cylinder was not a new one, having been employed
by printers of copper-plate engravings in the fifteenth century.
Their machines, however, were rude in form, and made of wood, the
roller revolving in stationary bearings, while the bed, with the
plate upon it and carrying the paper, covered by a blanket, on its
surface, moved backward and forward under the roller. The inking was
done by hand with balls. With the inauguration of this system of
printing from type or forms placed upon a flat bed moved forwards
and backwards under a revolving cylinder, commenced an entirely new
era in the history of the printing press. It should be understood,
however, that the vast number of patents granted for printing
machines in which the cylinder is connected with the bed, or by
the operation of two cylinders together, one holding the form and
the other giving the impression, are almost all for improvements
and devices of detail, the radical principles upon which these are
founded remaining the same. Thus, Sir Rowland Hill, in the early

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>

part of the nineteenth century, projected a machine for printing from
an endless roll, or “web” of paper; and in 1790 an Englishman named
William Nicholson (author, inventor, patent agent, editor and school
teacher) took out a patent covering the idea of cylinder presses in
which the forms should be placed upon either a flat bed or cylinder
at will and receive the impression from a cylinder covered with cloth
or some similar material. Between the bed and cylinder, or between
the two cylinders, the sheet was to be fed in and printed. The ink
was to be put on by a roller built up of cloth and covered with
leather. There is, however, a great difference between an actual
invention and a scheme. If the simple proposition advanced to make a
machine upon this principle, without its consummation, or without any
press being produced, can be considered an invention, then Nicholson
may (as a writer on the subject states) have been “so far ahead of
his time as to leap over three generations” by his invention. As a
matter of fact, however, his patents were mostly schemes, and little
more, as a moment’s reflection will convince. He did not know how to
curve the plates to be put upon the cylinders, nor how to secure them
properly for good work&mdash;in fact, he did not know how to make the
plates in any practicable manner. All these questions remained to be
solved in order that the printing press might be an invention. On
this account, therefore, I do not give descriptions of proposals to
make machines, but of presses that have been actually made, and used
sufficiently to entitle them to recognition as practical improvements
exemplifying the progressive evolution of the printing press.</p>

<p>The foundation and growth of newspapers first published
periodically, and finally each day, created a demand for machines
which should print with rapidity, and fine work was delegated for the
time being to the flat bed and platen press, most of it, as has been
seen, being turned out upon the hand press.</p>

<p>The credit of actually introducing into use a flat bed Cylinder

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>

Press is due to a Saxon named Friederich Koenig, who visited England
in 1806, and through the assistance of Thomas Bensley, a printer
in London, devised a machine which in 1812-1813 was worked by him,
and printed, among other publications, a part of “Clarkson’s Life
of William Penn.” Koenig was assisted by a mechanic named Andrew
Bauer, a fellow-countryman. The form of type was placed on a flat
bed, the cylinder above it having a three-fold motion, or stopping
three times; the first third of the turn receiving the sheet upon
one of the tympans and securing it by the frisket; the second giving
the impression and allowing the sheet to be removed by hand, and the
third returning the tympan empty to receive another sheet.</p>

<p>These men also devised what has proved, even to this day, to be a
most efficient reciprocating motion of the type bed. It consists of
a pinion carried on the inner end of a long shaft which is turned by
gearing from the outside of the press frame and has in its length a
universal joint, allowing an up-and-down motion of the pinion as it
revolves. To the outer end of the shaft the wheel connecting with
the impression cylinder is attached. Underneath the bed and fastened
to it is a “rack,” or a row of teeth, with a crescent-shaped segment
of hard metal at each end. In this rack, in addition to the teeth,
are pins, or studs, at each end. The wheel before referred to, at
the outer end of the shaft, being set in motion revolves the pinion
and moves the bed by means of the teeth in this rack. At the proper
moment, calling for the reversal of the bed, the pinion turns around
over one of the pins or studs, against the segment on the rack, and
immediately re-engages its teeth in the opposite side of the rack, so
carrying the bed back again. This motion is repeated at the opposite
end of the rack, and the bed again stopped and returned by the pinion
revolving against the segment and again over the rack, thus giving a
reciprocating motion to the bed.</p>

<p>In 1814 Koenig patented a continuously revolving Cylinder

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>

Press. The part of the periphery of the cylinder not used for giving
the impression is slightly reduced in diameter, so as to allow the
form to return under it freely after giving an impression. He showed
designs adapting it for use as a single Cylinder Press, and also a
two Cylinder Press, both for printing one side of the paper at a
time; likewise a two Cylinder Press for printing both sides of the
paper at one operation. In this later press, the two forms were
placed one at each end of a long bed, and the paper after being
printed on one side by one cylinder, was carried by tapes over a
registering roller to the other cylinder, where it was printed upon
the reverse side. This press, termed a “perfecting press,” was
afterwards improved by Applegath &amp; Cowper so as to be a very
efficient machine.</p>

<p>Koenig erected in the office of the London “Times” in 1814 two of
the two Cylinder Presses mentioned above, which printed on one side
of the paper only, at the rate of 800 sheets per hour.</p>

<p>Koenig, however, was not alone in his efforts to perfect a
Cylinder Press. Various patents were gotten out by Bacon &amp; Donkin
in 1813; by Cowper in 1816 and again in 1818; and by Applegath in
1818. But the most ingenious and practical device in connection with
the movements of a flat bed and a cylinder for printing machines was
patented by Napier in 1828 and 1830. He was the first who introduced
“grippers,” or “fingers,” for the conveyance of the sheets around
the cylinder during the impression, and for delivering them after
printing. Tapes or strings had previously been employed for this
purpose. He was also the first to manufacture presses in which
the impression cylinders are of small size and make two or more
revolutions to each sheet printed, and he devised the toggles for
bringing the cylinders down to print on the form and for raising them
to let the form run back without touching.</p>

<p>The news of these later inventions reached New York in due time,
and in 1832 Robert Hoe, who had been some time established

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>

in the manufacture of printing presses, sent a young man, Sereno
Newton (whom he afterwards took in partnership with him), to England
to investigate the subject and see what improvements were worthy of
adoption. The result was the construction of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>

machines known as the “Single Small Cylinder” and “Double Small
Cylinder,” also the large Cylinder “Perfecting” Press, which have
continued, with many alterations and improvements, to be manufactured
up to the present time.</p>

  <div class="captionx">SINGLE LARGE CYLINDER PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>Hoe &amp; Co. had previously made the first flat bed and cylinder
press ever used in the United States. It was the pattern known as
the “Single Large Cylinder,” the whole circumference of the cylinder
being equivalent to the entire travel of the bed forwards and
backwards, the cylinder making one revolution for each impression
in printing, without stopping. Only a portion of the cylinder was
employed to take the impression, the remainder of its circumference being

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>

turned down small enough to allow the type on the bed to pass back
under it without touching. Hundreds of these machines were made and
are now in use, and they are still made at the present day, with
patented sheet fliers and other devices and improvements in the
methods of manufacture. Other similar presses were made later by
the press-makers A. B. Taylor, A. Campbell, C. B. Cottrell, and C.
Potter, Jr.</p>

<p>The patented sheet flier before referred to, and which was used on
the “Adams” bed and platen press, was greatly improved by Hoe &amp;
Co. and placed upon all their cylinder presses.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further with an account of the faster newspaper
presses, it may be well to complete the history of machines employed
up to this time for book, job and woodcut printing. For this purpose
the “Single Large Cylinder,” already described, was first used. In
England there were the “Napier” presses, the “Wharfdale” and many
others, all involving the same general principle, and capable of
turning out more or less satisfactory work, in proportion to the
perfection of their construction and the skill of those operating
them. Most of the English machines, however, show defects in
mechanical construction. In fact, the supremacy of the American
printing press is maintained in a large measure by the simplicity,
accuracy and perfection of its mechanism. Foreign presses, made by
the cheap labor of Europe, have been repeatedly brought to this
country and introduced into printing offices. They have never,
however, lasted long, most of them having perished in the using or
been found unprofitable.</p>

<p>There have been various modifications of the principle underlying
the Napier movement for flat-bed presses, i. e., having the driving
wheel engage the rack at all times, reversing the movement by turning
about the ends of the rack and driving the bed alternately in
opposite directions.</p>

<p>As early as 1847 Hoe &amp; Co. patented an entirely new bed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>

driving mechanism. To a hanger fixed on the lower side of the bed
were attached two racks facing each other, but not in the same
vertical plane, and separated by a distance equal to the diameter
of the driving wheel, which was on a horizontal shaft and movable
sideways so as to engage in either one or other of the racks. By this
means, a uniform movement was obtained in each direction.</p>

<p>The reversal of the bed was accomplished by a roller at either end
of the bed entering a recess in a disc on the driving shaft, which
in a half revolution brought the bed to a stop and started it in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>This involved a new principle; a crank action operating directly
upon the bed from a shaft having a fixed centre, and within recent
years modifications of this patent have been successfully employed to
drive the type bed at a high velocity and reverse it without shock or
vibration.</p>

<p>The “Miehle” Press is a modified form of this movement; the crank
pin or roller is attached to the side of the bed wheel, and at the
ends of the uniform movement it is enclosed within the walls of a
vertical guideway formed at each end of the rack supporting frame,
and passes through the length of this guide as it performs its
function of reversing the bed.</p>

<p>An improvement in this class of bed motions has lately been made
and patented by Hoe &amp; Co. In this machine the crank pin, which
controls the reversal of the motion of the type bed, moves in a
rectilinear instead of a circular pathway. As the motion of the crank
is thus directly in line with the travel of the bed, it is possible
to lock the journal box, enclosing the pin, securely to the bed,
while the bed is being controlled by the action of the crank, and
thereby avoids the friction and consequent wear of parts that occur
when the crank pin moves in a circular line. The movement of the
crank is obtained from the rotatory motion of the bed wheel, and has
the same varying velocities as would be derived from a crank

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>

traveling in a circular pathway. It, therefore, checks the momentum
of the bed with ease, brings the bed to rest, and returns it with
an accelerating motion while under positive control. The wearing
of parts is thus reduced to the minimum, insuring an accuracy of
register and exactness of motion hitherto unattainable. A press with
a bed measuring 48 × 65 inches runs without jar or vibration at a
speed of 1,800 impressions an hour.</p>

<p>The press of the present day from which the finest letterpress
and woodcut work is turned off is known as the “Stop Cylinder.” This
was devised and patented by a Frenchman named Dutartre, in 1852, and
introduced into this country about 1853 by Hoe &amp; Co., who have
since patented many improvements upon it. It was a surprise to many
printers to find that this machine could do work which heretofore it
had been supposed the hand press only was capable of performing.</p>

  <div class="captionx">STOP CYLINDER LITHOGRAPHIC PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>The Stop Cylinder Press may be described as follows: The type
is secured upon a traveling iron bed, which moves back and forth
upon friction rollers of steel, the bed being driven by a simple
crank motion, stopping and starting it without noise or jar. All the
running portions of this bed are made of fine steel as hard as it
can be worked. The cylinder is stopped by a cam motion pending the
backward travel of the bed, and during the interval of rest the sheet
is fed down against the guides and the grippers closed upon it before
the cylinder starts, thus insuring the utmost accuracy of register.
After the impression, the sheet is transferred to a skeleton
cylinder, also containing grippers, which receives, and delivers it,
over fine cords, upon the sheet flier, which in turn deposits it
upon the table. The distribution of the ink is effected partly by a
vibrating, polished, steel cylinder, and partly upon a flat table
at the end of the traveling bed, the number of form-inking rollers
varying from four to six. This is without doubt the most perfect flat
bed cylinder printing machine that has ever been

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>

devised. It is made in various sizes. The average output of one
of these presses with a bed 36 × 54 inches is from 1,000 to 1,500
impressions per hour.</p>

<p>The demand being constantly for machines taking on larger sized
forms, there has been lately constructed and patented by R. Hoe &amp;
Co. an entirely new Stop Cylinder Press, having a bed 45 × 62 inches,
and which can be run at a speed of 1,700 impressions an hour. The
main points of difference between the Stop Cylinder Press for type
forms and the Lithographic Press is in the form of the bed only,
the other portions, including the driving apparatus, being almost
identical; therefore the same general description applies to these
new machines for both classes of work. A great objection to flat-bed
presses of large size has always been the height of the cylinder from
the floor, necessitated by the increased dimensions of the driving
apparatus under the bed. In these new presses the bed is reciprocated
as usual by a crank motion, but made exceptionally strong and
compounded. This method of construction not only gives the increased
speed but makes the bed of the machine low down, so that it is better
under the hand and eye of the operator. The product of the machine
is delivered printed side up, by a patented take-off apparatus,
which takes the sheets from the impression cylinder by grippers in a
reciprocating carriage and deposits them upon a table. No tapes or
guides come in contact with the freshly printed ink.</p>

  <div class="captionx">ROTARY ZINCOGRAPHIC OR ALUMINUM PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>Keeping pace with the improved methods and machines employed in
typographic printing, and influenced thereby, the lithographic and
kindred branches of printing have also made progress, induced mainly,
however, by the general striving for more rapid and economical
production. This has been accomplished by using larger stones, paper
and machines, and by employing rotary machines for some work. The
use of curved stones for lithography being impracticable for many
reasons, a substitute was found in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>

plates or sheets made of zinc or aluminum, which, when properly
prepared, possess properties akin to those in lithographic stones.
Being flexible, these sheets are easily stretched over the curved
surface of a cylinder. Although the development of this branch of
printing is due, chiefly, to the French and Germans, much has been
done in this country toward its improvement, and work is produced
upon Rotary Zincographic or Aluminum Presses that compares favorably
with that produced from stones, and at double the speed. The smaller
of these presses, printing only one color at a time, prints on sheets
30 × 44 inches, at a speed up to 2,000 impressions per hour; the
larger presses of the same kind print on sheets 44 × 64 inches, at a
speed up to 1,700 impressions per hour, although the machines may be
run even faster, according to the dexterity of the feeder.</p>

  <div class="captionx">TWO-COLOR ROTARY ZINCOGRAPHIC OR ALUMINUM PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>Two-Color Rotary Presses are in successful operation in different
parts of this country. In these machines there are two plate
cylinders and one impression cylinder, each of the plate cylinders
having its own inking and dampening appliances. The sheet of paper,
after being fed to the grippers of the impression cylinder, receives
one printing from the first plate cylinder, and a second printing,
in a different color, from the second plate cylinder, and is then
released from the grippers and delivered in the usual manner by
the sheet flier. The size of the sheets printed is 44 × 64 inches,
and running at a speed of 1,700 revolutions per hour, the number
of printings is 3,400, or double that obtained from the one-color
machine of the same size.</p>

<p>We now return to a further consideration of the newspaper
press. The “Single Small Cylinder” and “Double Small Cylinder”
machines heretofore described as primarily the invention of Napier,
and perfected by Hoe &amp; Co. and made by them, came into general
use in the United States. In construction and for the quantity and
quality of work produced they excelled any made in England; the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>

output of one of the “Single Cylinder” presses reaching 2,000
impressions per hour, or about as fast as the feeder could lay
down the sheets. When still greater speed was required the “Double
Cylinder” press was used, the travel of the bed being of such
length that the form of type passed backward and forward under both
cylinders. Two feeders accordingly put in the sheets; the maximum
speed obtained being about 2,000 from each cylinder, or 4,000 from
the two cylinders per hour, printed on one side. It was evident, both
in England and America, that something faster must be devised. The
growing demand for papers containing the latest news necessitated
increasing effort on the part of the machine-makers. The presses of
Dryden &amp; Ford, Middleton, and others in England failed to meet
the requirements there, as did the “Single” and
“<ins class="corr" id="tn31" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Added double quote to “Double”.">Double</ins>”
Cylinders in America.</p>

  <div class="captionx">TEN CYLINDER ROTARY TYPE-REVOLVING PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>In 1845 and 1846 the firm of R. Hoe &amp; Co. in New York were
busily engaged upon plans and inventions for presses which should
meet the increased requirements of the newspapers in America. The
result was the construction of a press known as the “Hoe Type
Revolving Machine,” embodying patents taken out by Richard M.
Hoe. The first one of these machines was placed in the “Ledger”
office in Philadelphia, in 1846. The basis of these inventions
consisted in an apparatus for securely fastening the forms of type
on a central cylinder placed in a <em>horizontal</em> position. This was
accomplished by the construction of cast-iron beds, one for each
page of the newspaper. The column rules were made “V” shaped; i. e.,
tapering toward the feet of the type. It was found that, with proper
arrangement for locking up or securing the type upon these beds, it
could be held firmly in position, the surface form a true circle,
and the cylinder revolved at any speed required without danger of
the type falling out. Around this central cylinder from four to ten
impression cylinders, according to the output required, were grouped.
The sheets were fed in by boys, and taken from the feed board

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>

by automatic grippers, or fingers, operated by cams in the impression
cylinders, and which conveyed them around against the revolving form

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>

of the central cylinder. Here again a great advantage was gained by
the use of the patented sheet flier, consisting of a row of long

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>

wooden fingers fastened to the shaft, and operated by a cam and
springs; the sheet after printing being conducted out underneath each

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>

feed board by means of tapes to the sheet fliers, which laid them
in piles on tables; the number of fliers and tables corresponding

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>

to the number of impression cylinders. The inking was accomplished
by the use of composition rollers placed between each of the
impression cylinders; the fountain being below, underneath the main
type cylinder. The portion of the surface of this type cylinder,
not occupied by the type itself, was utilized as a distributing
table, its surface being lower than that of the type, and the inking
rollers rising and falling alternately to place the ink on the type
and receive a new supply from the distributing surface. The first of
these presses had only four impression cylinders, necessitating four
boys to feed the sheets. The running speed obtained was about 2,000
sheets to each feeder per hour, thus giving, with what was called
a “Four Feeder” or “Four Cylinder” machine, a running capacity of
about 8,000 papers, per hour, printed upon one side. As the demands
of the newspapers increased, more impression cylinders were added,
until these machines were made with as many as ten grouped around
the central cylinder, giving an aggregate speed of about 20,000
papers per hour printed upon one side. A revolution in newspaper
printing took place. Journals which before had been limited in
their circulation by their inability to furnish the papers rapidly
increased their issues, and many new ones were started. The new
presses were adopted not only throughout the United States, but also
in Great Britain. The first one put up abroad was erected in 1848, in
the office of “La Patrie” in Paris, but the downfall of
the Republic and the re-imposition of a stamp duty, soon put

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>

an end to all enterprise in French newspaper publishing. The English,
always slow to adopt improvements, did not appreciate the value of
these presses until the year 1856, when Edward Lloyd of “Lloyd’s
Weekly Newspaper” in London, having seen the one in the office of “La
Patrie,” ordered a “Six-Cylinder” machine. This was erected in his
office in Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, London, in the following
year. It was no sooner in operation and seen by the other newspaper
proprietors than orders were received from the London “Times” for two
“Ten-Cylinder” presses, to replace the Applegath machine they were
then using. The order for these machines was a gratifying tribute to
American ingenuity, for the “Times” in December, 1848, in an article
on the starting of the Applegath vertical cylinder press, stated that
“No art of packing could make the type adhere to a cylinder revolving
around a horizontal axis and thereby aggravating centrifugal impulse
by the intrinsic weight of the metal.” Eventually orders from almost
all of the leading newspapers in Great Britain and Ireland were
received.</p>

<p>In the meantime various experiments had demonstrated the
possibility of casting stereotype plates on a curve. The process was
brought to perfection by the use of flexible paper matrices, upon
which the metal was cast in curved moulds to any circle desired,
and these plates were placed upon the Hoe “Type Revolving Machine”
upon beds adapted to receive them instead of the type forms. The
newspaper publishers were thus enabled to duplicate the forms, and
run several machines at the same time with a view of turning out the
papers with greater rapidity. In some large offices, such as the New
York “Herald,” London “Daily Telegraph,” and the London “Standard,”
as many as five of these machines were in constant operation. About
this time the stamp duty in England of one penny upon each sheet of
printed matter was repealed. This in itself aided materially in the
development of the newspaper press.</p>

  <div class="captionx">APPLEGATH’S TYPE-REVOLVING PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>After the return of Koenig to Germany, an Englishman named
Applegath, in connection with a machinist named Cowper, made
various improvements, mostly in the way of simplifying Koenig’s
presses. After many experiments, they in 1848 constructed for the
London “Times” an elaborate machine, entirely upon the cylindrical
principle. All of the cylinders of this machine instead of being
horizontal, as in presses heretofore used, were vertical. The
type was placed upon a large upright central cylinder, but the
circumference instead of presenting a complete circle represented
as many flat surfaces as there were columns in the newspaper, the
forms thus being polygonal. Around this central or form cylinder were
placed eight smaller vertical cylinders for taking the impression,
inking rollers being introduced to ink the type as it passed
alternately from one of these impression cylinders to another. The
sheets were fed down by hand from eight flat horizontal feed-boards
through tapes; then grasped by another set of tapes and passed
sideways between the impression cylinder and the type cylinder, thus
obtaining sheets printed upon one side. The impression cylinder
delivered them, still in a vertical position, into the hands of boys,
one stationed at each cylinder to receive them. The results obtained
from this machine were in a measure satisfactory, as the number of
papers printed per hour upon one side, from one form of type, was
materially increased; not, however, in proportion to the number of
impression cylinders placed around it, as the press at its best could
produce but 8,000 impressions per hour, on one side of the sheets.
Having devised no means to lock up the type other than in flat
columns, the polygonal form was a necessity, and the irregularities
in it were made up by underlaying the blankets on the impression
cylinders to take up these inequalities. Although this press, used in
the London “Times” office, was the only one of the kind ever made,
its size and importance warrant some record and description of it. This

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>

machine was taken out to make way for Hoe Type Revolving Presses.</p>

<p>In 1835 Sir Rowland Hill had suggested the possibilities of
a machine which should print both sides at once from a roll of
paper. It is well known that for many years cotton cloths had been
printed in this way, the cylinders being engraved and the cloth
after printing being reeled up again. The suggestion, however, was
accompanied by no practical knowledge as to the details, and, above
all, no practical provision for the rapid cutting off and delivery of
the paper either before or after it had been printed. It remained for
an American, William Bullock, of Philadelphia, to construct, in 1865,
the first printing machine to print from a continuous web or roll
of paper. His machine consisted of two pairs of cylinders, i. e.,
two form or plate cylinders and two impression cylinders. The second
impression cylinder was made of large size to provide additional
tympan surface, to lessen the offset from the first printed side of
the paper. The stereotype plates were not made to fill the whole
circumference of each of the form cylinders, as the sheets were
cut before printing. One difficulty he had to contend with was the
cutting off of the sheets with sufficient accuracy and rapidity. This
he accomplished by severing them by means of knives in cylinders. The
sheets were then carried through the press by tapes and fingers, and
delivery sought to be accomplished by means of a series of automatic
metal nippers placed upon endless leather belts at such distance
apart as to grasp each sheet successively as it came from the last
printing cylinders. This machine was put up in several offices and
rejected because of its unreliability, especially in the delivery of
the papers, but it was finally so far perfected that it came into use
to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the proprietors of the London “Times” inaugurated
experiments with the view of making a rotary perfecting press,
and finally started the first one in that office about 1868. It was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>

similar in construction to the “Bullock” press so far as the printing
apparatus was concerned, excepting that the cylinders were all of one

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>

size and placed one above the other. The sheets were severed after
printing, brought up by tapes, and carried down to a sheet flier

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>

which moved back and forth, and “flirted” the sheets alternately into
the hands of two boys seated opposite one another on either side of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>

the sheet flier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

  <div class="captionx">LONDON TIMES ROTARY MACHINE</div>
</div>

<p>Marinoni, of Paris, also devised a machine on a similar principle,
making the impression and the form cylinder of one size, and placed
them one above the other. The “Marinoni” machine had separate fly
boards for the delivery of the sheets.</p>

<p>In 1871 R. Hoe &amp; Co. also turned their attention to the
construction of a rotary perfecting press to print from a roll or
continuous web of paper.</p>

<p>As before stated, the greatest difficulties to be encountered
were:&mdash;</p>

<p>First. The set-off of the first side.</p>

<p>Devices were used to overcome this and the ink-makers were induced
to pay special attention to the manufacture of rapid-drying or
non-setting-off inks.</p>

<p>Second. The difficulties in obtaining paper in the roll of uniform
perfection and strength. The paper-makers were led to make a study of
producing large rolls of paper meeting these requirements, and became
much more experienced in its manufacture. The “Walter” press in the
“Times” office had necessitated a very strong and expensive paper,
which could not be afforded by the cheap daily press.</p>

<p>Third. The difficulty of the rapid severing of the sheets after
printing.</p>

<p>Fourth. A reliable and accurate delivery of the printed papers.</p>

<p>These last two operations were not accomplished satisfactorily

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>

until the appearance of the Hoe machine. In this press the sheets
were not entirely severed by the cutters, but simply perforated after
the printing. They were then drawn by accelerating tapes, which
completely separated them, onto a gathering cylinder so constructed
that six perfect papers, or any other desired number, could be
gathered one over the other. These, by means of a switch, were at
the proper moment turned off onto one sheet flier, which deposited
them on the receiving board. This gathering and delivery cylinder,
patented by Stephen D. Tucker, a member of the firm of R. Hoe &amp;
Co., solved the problem of rapid flat delivery. The first of these
machines was placed in the office of “Lloyd’s Weekly Newspaper,” in
London, and the first one used in the United States in the “Tribune”
office in New York. There was no limit to their capacity for printing
excepting the ability of the paper to stand the strain of passing
through the press, which produced, when put to its speed, 18,000
perfect papers an hour, delivered accurately on one feed-board. The
average speed, however, in printing offices was 12,000, although in
some offices they were run at about 14,000 per hour.</p>

<p>The “Walter” press, made by the London “Times,” was used by it,
and also by the London “Daily News” and by the New York “Times.”
Further than that it made no progress and has now gone entirely out
of use, the presses of this kind in the London “Times” office having
been replaced by machines made by R. Hoe &amp; Co. Meantime their
machines were adopted by most of the large newspapers in the United
States and Great Britain.</p>

<p>These new methods, of course, entirely superseded the “Hoe Type
Revolving Machine,” which had reigned supreme in the newspaper world
for over twenty years, and of which one hundred and seventy-five had
been made, almost all of which have now disappeared.</p>

<p>Up to the middle of the last century the paper had been

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>

made from rags, but as these became unobtainable in sufficient
quantity some substitute had to be found. First straw and afterwards
wood pulp was successfully employed, and paper made from the latter
is now in universal use. Its cheapness (averaging now about three
cents per pound) materially aided the newspapers, and stimulated the
printing machine manufacturers to renewed efforts in devising presses
of still greater speed and efficiency.</p>

<p>It was desirable also that the papers should be delivered folded
ready for the carrier or mail. The first apparatus to accomplish this
was similar in design to the hand-fed folding machine in common use
in printing offices. The sheets, fed separately into these machines,
were carried by tapes running upon pulleys under striking blades,
which forced them between pairs of folding rollers. After the first
fold they were again carried in a similar manner under striking
blades, placed at right angles to the first, and again struck down
between rollers to receive a second fold. This action was continued
until the desired number of folds had been secured. Folders of this
description were attached to the fast presses, but none made could
be worked at a greater speed than about 8,000 per hour, until in
1875 Stephen D. Tucker patented a rotating folding cylinder which
folded papers as fast as they came from the press, or 15,000 in the
hour. The striking blade folders were used in the “Bullock” press,
in machines made by C. Potter, Jr., &amp; Co. and others. Andrew
Campbell, a printing press manufacturer, also constructed a rotary
perfecting press, but his devices were not original. Four or five
machines were made by him, and these soon went out of use.</p>

  <div class="captionx">FIRST HOE WEB PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>The first folders made by Hoe &amp; Co. consisted of the
combination of a “gathering cylinder” with a rotary folding cylinder
and tapes conveying the printed sheets under horizontal folding
blades, somewhat similar to those before described, which thrust them
at the proper moment between folding rollers placed at alternate

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>

angles, finally delivering them on travelling belts by a small
flier. The first of these folding machines were put upon the presses
made for the Philadelphia “Times” and operated in the Centennial
Exhibition, in 1876.</p>

<p>These folders, however, were only the commencement of a long
series of experiments undertaken by the makers in the development
of still faster printing and folding mechanisms, and from this time
forward the progress made has been phenomenal. With great ingenuity,
added to long experience, and by the acquisition and adaptation of
every device which should aid them in their efforts, Hoe &amp; Co.
succeeded in providing machines of unrivalled designs, efficiency and
speed.</p>

<p>About 1876 Messrs. Anthony &amp; Taylor of England (the former
one of the owners of a newspaper in Hereford) took out patents
for devices by which the webs of paper could be turned over after
printing on one side and the opposite or reversed side presented
to the printing cylinder. Mr. Hoe, who was in England at the time,
appreciating the possible use and development of these patents,
became possessed of them for England and the United States.</p>

<p>E. L. Ford, engaged in the publication of a newspaper in New
York, patented the uniting of the product of two or more printing
mechanisms and thus producing (in restricted form) a multiple number
of pages at one time. He was unable, however, to develop his plans to
any practical result; but deserves the credit of being the first to
patent, if not to conceive, the idea of the association of printed
sheets for this purpose.</p>

  <div class="captionx">DOUBLE SUPPLEMENT PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>In the various experiments of Hoe &amp; Co. bearing upon the
manipulation of webs of paper some of their devices appeared to
encroach upon patents secured by Luther C. Crowell, inventor,
of Boston, who had made an ingenious machine for forming paper
bags. These patents were immediately secured by purchase and the
experimental work proceeded with the view of adapting some of them to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>

the requirements of the printing press. After many efforts, and
the failure and destruction of several machines which had been

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>

constructed at great expense, the Hoe “Double Supplement” machine was
produced, the first one being purchased by James Gordon Bennett of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>

the New York “Herald” and put to work in his office. The result of
these efforts has been, for a third time, a complete revolution of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>

the methods of fast newspaper printing. The most remarkable features
of this machine are: Its extreme simplicity, considering the varied

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>

work it performs, and its great speed, accuracy and efficiency. It
turns out either four, six, eight, ten or twelve page papers at

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>

24,000 per hour, and sixteen page papers at 12,000 per hour; the odd
pages being in every case accurately inserted and pasted in, and the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>

papers cut at top and delivered folded. This machine is constructed
in two parts, the cylinders in one portion being twice the length
of those in the other; the short cylinders being used for the
supplements of the paper when it is desired to print more than eight
pages. The plates being secured on the cylinders, the paper enters
from the two rolls into the two portions of the machine, through each
of which it is carried between the two pairs of type and impression
cylinders, and printed on both sides, after which the two broad
ribbons or “webs” pass over turning bars and other devices, by which
they are laid evenly one over the other, and pasted together. The
webs of paper then pass down upon a triangular “former,” which folds
them along the center margin. They are then taken over a cylinder,
from which they receive the final fold, a revolving blade within
this cylinder projecting and thrusting the paper between folding
rollers, while at the same moment a knife in the same cylinder severs
the sheet, and a rapidly revolving mechanism, resembling in its
motion the fingers of a hand, causes their accurate disposal upon
traveling belts, which convey them on for final removal. From this
rather summary description it will be apparent that the principle of
retaining the paper in the web, or unsevered

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>

form, up to the final fold and delivery, and performing all the
operations without retarding the onward run of the paper, effectually
prevents chokes or stoppages through any miscarriage of sheets
severed before the folding. Several hundred of these machines have
been made and put in operation by the United States; and in offices
of the large newspapers in Great Britain and other countries.</p>

<p>Previous to the introduction of the “Double Supplement” press,
however, Hoe &amp; Co. had made what is known as the “Double
Perfecting” machine. The success of this press, which embraces
substantially the printing and folding devices embodied in the
“Double Supplement” machine, was the connecting link between the
ordinary “single” or two-page-wide press and the “Double Supplement”
machine.</p>

  <div class="captionx">QUADRUPLE PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>The next improvement in fast presses was the construction of
the machine known as the “Quadruple” Newspaper Press. This was a
step in advance of anything heretofore attempted. The first one
was constructed in 1887 and placed in the office of the New York
“World.” The same principles were embraced in this as in the “Double
Supplement,” but developed to a greater extent. The supplement
portion of the press was increased in width. By means of ingenious
arrangements and manipulation of the webs of paper this press was
made to produce eight-page papers at a running speed of 48,000 per
hour; also 24,000 per hour of either ten, twelve, fourteen or sixteen
page papers; all delivered with great exactness and perfection; cut
at the top, pasted and folded ready for the carrier or the mails.</p>

  <div class="captionx">STRAIGHT-LINE PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>Another form of the Double Supplement and Quadruple machines,
embodying substantially the same principles, is what has been termed
the “straight-line” press. In this form of construction the cylinders
are arranged in horizontal rows, or tiers, one
above the other, there being two pairs of cylinders in each tier,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>

with the folding and delivery apparatus at the end of the machine.
Some of these presses, made under the patent of Joseph L. Firm, and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
which belong to R. Hoe &amp; Co., have been constructed.</p>

  <div class="captionx">SEXTUPLE PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>It was thought that the limit of printing capacity in one machine
had been reached in this new invention, but in 1889 the same firm
undertook the task of constructing a machine for Mr. Bennett of the
“New York Herald,” which would even eclipse the “Quadruple” machine,
which had, together with the “Double Supplement” press, superseded
almost all others in the large offices of the United States, as well
as in Great Britain and Australia. The press made for the “New York
Herald” and known as the “Sextuple” machine, occupied about eighteen
months in construction. It is composed of about sixteen thousand
pieces. The general arrangement differs entirely from that of the
“Quadruple” machine. The form and impression cylinders are all placed
parallel, instead of any being at right angles as in the “Quadruple”
and “Double Supplement” Presses. To give an idea of this machine, we
cannot do better than to quote the description of it in the “New York
Herald” of May 10th, 1891.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The new Hoe press which is being set up in the ‘Herald,’ Building
is nothing less than a miracle of mechanism. To say that it is the
only one of the kind ever built and that it throws all previous
inventions into the background are facts which the following figures
abundantly prove.</p>

<p>“Its consumption of white paper is so astounding that even the
imagination grows tired and sits down to catch its breath. It is
fed from three rolls, each being more than five feet wide. When
it settles down to show its best work it will use up in one hour
nearly twenty-six miles of this paper, or to make the matter more
significant, it will use up about fifty-two miles of paper the
ordinary width of the ‘Herald’ every sixty minutes.</p>

<p>“Our readers will be startled to learn that it can print and fold

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>

ninety thousand four-page ‘Heralds’ in an hour. This is, to the mind,
which is not versed in the problem of rapid printing, a feat which
makes Aladdin’s lamp an old woman’s fable. Ninety thousand per hour
means fifteen hundred copies per minute, or twenty-five copies for
every second of time ticked by the clock in Trinity’s steeple.</p>

<p>“It is, of course, the last and best result of modern
invention&mdash;the highest attainment of genius at the present
time.</p>

<p>“This new press will print, cut, paste, fold, count and deliver
72,000 eight-page ‘Heralds’ in one hour, which is equivalent to 1,200
a minute and 20 a second.</p>

<p>“It will print, cut, paste, fold, count and deliver complete
48,000 ten or twelve-page ‘Heralds’ in one hour, which is equivalent
to 800 a minute and a fraction over 13 a second.</p>

<p>“It will print, cut, paste, fold, count and deliver complete
36,000 sixteen-page ‘Heralds’ an hour, which is at the rate of 600 a
minute or 10 a second.</p>

<p>“It will print, cut, paste, fold, count and deliver complete
24,000 fourteen, twenty or twenty-four page ‘Heralds’ an hour, which
is at the rate of 400 a minute, or very nearly seven a second.</p>

<p>“This is lightning work with a vengeance and yet it is possible
that there may be some who read this who will live to call it slow.
That will probably be when they have found out all about how to put a
harness on electricity. No one can predict when inventive genius will
reach its limit in the printing press. But for the present this new
press marks high water mark.</p>

<p>“Before this press was built the fastest presses in the world
were Hoe’s ‘Quadruple’ Presses, of which the ‘Herald’ has two. These
presses turn out 48,000 four, six or eight-page papers an hour,
24,000 ten, twelve, fourteen or sixteen-page papers an hour, and
12,000 twenty or twenty-four-page papers an hour, all cut, pasted and
folded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>“This new press has a well-nigh insatiable appetite for white
paper. To satisfy it, it is fed from three rolls at the same
time, one roll being attached at either end of the press and the
third suspended near the center. It is the only press that has
ever been able to accomplish that feat. Each roll is sixty-three
inches wide, or twice the width of the ‘Herald.’ When doing its
best this press will consume 25⅞ miles of sixty-three-inch-wide
paper&mdash;equivalent to 51¾ miles of paper the width of the
‘Herald’&mdash;in one hour, and eject it at the two deliveries in
the shape of ‘Heralds,’ each copy containing an epitome of the news
of the world for the preceding twenty-four hours, and each copy cut,
pasted and folded ready for delivery to the ‘Herald’ readers. It is a
sight worth seeing to see it done. Certainly we know of nothing else
which affords such a striking example of the triumph of mechanical
genius.</p>

<p>“A man turns a lever, shafts and cylinders begin to revolve, the
whirring noise settles into a steady roar, you see three streams
of white paper pouring into the machine from the three huge rolls,
and you pass around to the other side&mdash;it is literally snowing
newspapers at each of the two delivery outlets. So fast does one
paper follow the other that you catch only a momentary glitter from
the deft steel fingers that seize the papers and cast them out.</p>

<p>“The machine weighs about fifty-eight tons. It is massive and
strong, with the strength of a thousand giants. And yet though its
arms are of steel and its motions are all as rapid as lightning, its
touch is as tender as that of a woman when she carries her babe. How
else does the machine avoid tearing the paper? It tears very readily,
as you often ascertain accidentally when turning over the leaves.
Truly wonderful it is, and mysterious to anybody but an expert, how
this huge machine can make newspapers at the rate of twenty-five a
second without rending the paper all to shreds.</p>

<p>“It has six plate cylinders, each cylinder carrying eight stereotype
plates, which represent eight pages of the ‘Herald,’ and six

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>

impression cylinders. These cylinders, when the press is working
at full speed make 200 revolutions a minute. The period of contact
between the paper and the plate cylinders is therefore inconceivably
brief, and how in that fractional space of time a perfect impression
is made, even to the reproduction of such fine lines as are shown in
these illustrations, is one of those things which, to the man who is
not ‘up’ in mechanics, must forever remain a mystery. But that it
does it you know, because you have the evidence of your own eyes.</p>

<p>“A double folder forms part of this machine. A single folder would
not be equal to the task imposed upon it. As it is, this double
folder has to exercise such celerity to keep up with the streams of
printed paper that descend upon it that its operations are too quick
for the eye to follow.</p>

<p>“The press has two delivery outlets. At each the papers are
automatically counted in piles of fifty. No matter how rapidly
the papers come out, there is never a mistake in the count. It is
as sure as fate. By an ingenious contrivance&mdash;if I should
attempt to describe it more definitely most people would be none the
wiser&mdash;each fiftieth paper is shoved out an inch beyond the
others that have been dropped onto the receiving tapes, thus serving
as a sort of tally mark.</p>

<p>“Truly it is a marvelous machine&mdash;this Sextuple press.
Nowhere will you find a more perfect adaption of means to ends;
nowhere in any branch of industry a piece of mechanism which offers
a finer example of what human skill and ingenuity is capable of. And
it is free from that reproach which is sometimes brought against the
greatest triumph of inventive genius in other departments of human
activity&mdash;that they make mere automatons out of human beings.</p>

<p>“The printing press is synonymous with progress, with the
diffusion of knowledge and the spread of ideas. Without the great

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>

improvements that have been made in it within the memory of many men
now living the modern newspaper, the best friend of liberty, and the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>

greatest foe of tyranny, would be an impossibility. It has more than
kept pace with the advancement in other departments of industry. In

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>

1829 the Washington Hand Press was introduced and regarded as quite
a mechanical triumph. At its best it printed 250 impressions an hour
on one side, or 125 complete newspapers of insignificant dimensions.
Now, a little over sixty years later, a machine is brought out which,
when the number of papers alone is compared, does 150 times as much
work in the same time, and which, if the comparison is extended to
the actual amount of printing done, does over 2,000 times as much
work.”</p></div>

  <div class="captionx">APPLETON ROTARY BOOK PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>About 1871 a machine called the “Prestonian” was made by Foster, a
machinist of Preston, England, and two or three were set to work, but
did not enjoy any great degree of favor. They embodied a combination
of the “Hoe Type Revolving Machine” with the “endless sheet
perfecting press.” The form of type for one side of the paper was
placed upon one cylinder, with impression cylinders around it, in the
manner of the Hoe press, and the form for the other side on another
cylinder, and the paper passed from one set of impression cylinders
to the other. The principal objection to this machine was its lack of
speed. The same principle, however, had been developed years before
in the “type revolving perfecting” presses (made by Hoe &amp; Co.)
which have two sets of type forms on separate large cylinders, the
sheets being fed in by hand and conveyed from one impression cylinder
to the other and against the forms by means of fingers or grippers.
The sheets were then delivered on a sheet flier. These presses were
especially designed for printing books, of which large numbers were
required, such as text books and spelling books. The contents of
a whole book could be placed on these cylinders and printed and
delivered at one impression. One of these machines constructed in 1852

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>

(fifty years ago) is still in operation at Messrs. D. Appleton &amp; Co.’s
printing office in Brooklyn, as active and efficient as ever.</p>

  <div class="captionx">ROTARY TYPE-REVOLVING WEB PERFECTING PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>In 1881 Hoe &amp; Co. turned their attention to the making of
a machine which should print <span class="allsmcap">FROM ONE FORM OF TYPE</span>
at a greater speed than had ever yet been attained. The result was
the “Rotary Type Endless-sheet Perfecting Press.” The principle of
this machine was in a measure that of their “Type-Revolving” press.
The forms of type for both sides of the paper were placed on a
central cylinder, which was surrounded by impression cylinders and
inking rollers.</p>

<p>There, were, however, no feeders and no grippers. The roll
of paper was placed at the end of the press, passed around the
impression cylinders arranged at one side of the form cylinder, and
then turned upside down at the lower part of the machine, thence
being carried upwards. The opposite or unprinted side was presented in
turn between each impression cylinder and the forms. If four impression

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>

cylinders were placed around the central cylinder then at each
revolution of the latter four perfect papers were printed. If eight
impression cylinders were placed around the central cylinder then
eight perfect papers were printed at one revolution of the main
or form cylinder. The speed attained by this machine with four
impression cylinders was about 12,000 per hour, and from machines
with eight impression cylinders 24,000 copies per hour were printed.
This press was especially adapted for afternoon papers when the
time or expense necessarily involved in stereotyping could not be
afforded. The majority of the machines made were provided with four
impression cylinders only. In the machines with eight impression
cylinders two rolls were used, one at either end of the machine, the
paper from each roll passing under the two first impression cylinders
on either side, each web then being turned over, and paper passed
between the two remaining cylinders on either side to print the
opposite sides of the sheets.</p>

<p>In this machine a folding apparatus was placed at each end to
receive the product of the rolls, but in the machine with four
impression cylinders only one folder was placed, at the end of the
machine opposite that at which the paper entered.</p>

<p>The experience gained in the construction of these fast newspaper
machines, and the accumulation of patented devices entering into
them, which were numbered by the score, had their influence in the
improvements which were made upon presses for the printing of weekly
newspapers, periodicals and magazines.</p>

  <div class="captionx">THREE PAGE WIDE PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>In 1888 was introduced a patented Hoe machine called the
“Three-page-wide Press.” It has a capacity of printing, perfecting
and delivering two-page papers, with one fold, at the rate of 60,000
per hour; four-page papers, with two folds, at 24,000 per hour,
six-page papers at 24,000 per hour; eight-page papers, folded twice,
or to carrier size, at 12,000 per hour, and twelve-page papers, folded in
the same manner as the eight-page, at the same speed, viz., 12,000

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>

per hour; all the supplement sheets being inset and pasted if desired.</p>

<p>The prominent features of this machine are:</p>

<p>The outside pages may receive the first or the last impression at
will, thus enabling large cuts and other similar work to be printed
without offset.</p>

<p>Grippers and horizontal folding knives and all tapes but short
leaders are done away with in the delivery and folding mechanisms,
the movements being all rotary.</p>

<p>The press occupies but a small space on the floor, being 6 feet 1
inch high, 8 feet wide and 15 feet 5 inches long over all.</p>

  <div class="captionx">NEWSPAPER AND PAMPHLET PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>In 1889 Hoe &amp; Co. constructed a patented perfecting machine in
which the plates, or forms, for both sides are placed upon one
cylinder, one side of the form of matter being placed upon one end,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>

or half of the cylinder, and the other side upon the opposite portion
of the cylinder. One impression cylinder only is used, and the inking
apparatus is greatly extended. This machine is remarkable for the
great variety of work it will do. At a high rate of speed, sheets of
eight, sixteen, twenty-four and so on up to ninety-six or one hundred
and twenty-eight pages may be printed and delivered folded in either
12mo, 8vo, 4to or folio sizes, ready for the binder. The press does
the work of ten flat-bed cylinder presses and ten hand-feed folding
machines. The paper is supplied to the machine from the roll, and
after printing passes over the “former” into the folding machine,
where the folding and cutting cylinders produce the required number
of pages in the form desired. Curved electrotypes are now made
successfully and this press was the first to bring the printing of
the average book and catalogue within the range of web press work.
While in general principles this machine is similar to the large
newspaper perfecting presses, though very much smaller in bulk, it
has increased facilities for distribution, and finer adjustments
throughout. The plates admit of underlays and overlays the same as
on a flat-bed press. There are no tapes, the folding being done on
rollers and small cylinders without smutting the printing. In the
folding apparatus there are knives which cut the sheet into the
right size for folding, after which they are automatically delivered
counted in lots of fifty each. The speed on a thirty-two page form
is about 16,000 copies per hour. This style of machine is probably
destined to revolutionize book and pamphlet printing, as it combines
the finest construction and facility of operation with the greatest
speed.</p>

<p>In 1886 a further advance was made toward perfection in the rotary
system of printing as adapted to doing fine work, in the construction
for Theodore L. De Vinne, the printer of the “Century” Magazine, by
Hoe &amp; Co., of a perfecting press to do the plain
forms of that periodical. The machine was described in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>

magazine, in an article written by Mr. De Vinne, here quoted from:</p>

<p class="fs90">(Extract from article published in the “Century” Magazine, November, 1890.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At the end of a long row of machinery stands the web press&mdash;a
massive and complicated construction, especially built by Hoe &amp;
Co. for printing, cutting and folding the plain and advertising pages
of the ‘Century.’ Web presses for newspapers are common enough,
but this press has distinction as the first, and for three years the only,
web press used in this country, for good book work. At one end
of the machine is a great roll of paper more than two miles long
when unwound, and weighing about 750 pounds. As the paper unwinds
it passes first over a jet of steam which slightly dampens and
softens its hard surface and fits it for receiving impressions, without
leaving it wet or sodden. It passes under a plate cylinder, on which
are thirty-two curved plates, inked by seven large rollers, which print
thirty-two pages on one side. Then it passes around a reversing cylinder

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>

which presents the other side of the paper to another plate cylinder,
on which are thirty-two plates which print exactly on the back
the proper pages for the thirty-two previously printed. This is done
quickly&mdash;in less than two seconds&mdash;but with exactness. But the web
of paper is still uncut. To do this it is drawn upward under a small
cylinder containing a concealed knife, which cuts the printed web in
strips two leaves wide and four leaves long. As soon as cut the sheets
are thrown forward on endless belts of tape. An ingenious but undetectable
mechanism gives to every alternate sheet a quicker movement,
so that it falls exactly over its predecessor, making two lapped
strips of paper. Busy little adjusters now come in play, placing these
lapped sheets of paper accurately up to a head and a side guide.
Without an instant of delay down comes a strong creasing blade over
the long center of the sheet, and pushes it out of sight. Pulleys at
once seize the creased sheet and press it flat, in which shape it is
hurried forward to meet three circular knives on one shaft, which
cut it across in four equal pieces. Disappearing for an instant from
view, it comes out on the other side of the upper end of the tail of
the press in the form of four folded sections of eight pages each.
Immediately after, at the lower end of the tail of the press, out come
four entirely different sections of eight pages each. This duplicate
delivery shows the product of the press to be at every revolution of
the cylinder sixty-four pages, neatly printed, truly cut, and accurately
registered and folded, ready for the binder. Two boys are kept fully
employed in seizing the folded sections and putting them in box
trucks, by which they are rolled out to the elevator, and on these sent
to the bindery. This web press is not so fast as the web press of
daily newspapers, but it performs more operations and does more accurate
work. It is not a large machine, nor is it noisy, nor does it seem
to be moving fast, but the paper goes through the cylinders at
the rate of nearly two hundred feet a minute. It does ten times
as much work as the noisier and more bustling presses by its side.”</p>

  <div class="captionx">ROTARY ART PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>The success of this perfecting press induced the makers to devise
a machine on the rotary principle adapted for the finest kind of
illustrations&mdash;in short, to make a press which should do work as fine
as it was possible to do on the hand press or the stop cylinder. The
result was the setting up, in 1890, at the De Vinne Press, of a
machine known as the “Rotary Art” press. This machine is
described in the “Century” of November, 1890, as follows:&mdash;“Sixty-four
plates of the ‘Century’ truly bent to the proper curve,
are firmly fastened on one cylinder sixty inches long, and about
thirty inches in diameter; sixteen inking rollers, supplied with ink
from two fountains, successfully ink these sixty-four plates with a
delicacy and yet with a fullness of color never before attained. The
shafts of the impression cylinder and the plate cylinders, 4½ inches
in diameter, do not give or spring under the strongest impression.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>

Although rigid in every part, in the hands of an expert pressman it
can be made responsive to the slightest overlay. This machine is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>

fed by four feeders from single sheets in the usual manner, and does
the work of four stop cylinders in superior style. The gain in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>

performance is not as great as the gain in quality of presswork, but
quality was considered more than speed. The performance of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>

machine could have been more than doubled by adding to it other
cylinders which would print on both sides of the paper; but careful

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>

experiment has proved that the <em>finest</em> woodcuts cannot be
properly printed with this rapidity. To get the best results the ink
on one side of the paper must be dry before it is printed on the
other side.”</p>

  <div class="captionx">“TIT BITS” PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>Among the most interesting modern printing machines are those
constructed by Hoe &amp; Co. at their London works, after drawings
and patterns sent from New York, for weekly English journals, such as
“Tit-Bits,” “Sunday Stories,” and similar periodicals. These machines
embody to a certain extent the principles of the “Double Supplement”
press before referred to. Double sets of plates are placed upon
the main machine, which is capable of taking on an aggregate of
twenty-four pages; and by using narrower rolls the number of pages
of the body of the journal may be reduced to sixteen or twenty, so
that the publisher may have the option of printing his paper either
sixteen, twenty or twenty-four pages. In addition to this it prints
a cover on a different colored paper, and all at the rate of 24,000
copies per hour; the whole product, including the cover, being cut on
the edges and pasted together at the back. The supplement or cover of
the press portion, however, instead of having two pairs of cylinders,
as in the “Double Supplement” machine, consists of one form cylinder
and one impression cylinder. This portion of the machine prints the
cover, which is fed from a narrower roll, and, as before stated, of
an entirely different color or quality of paper from the body of the
journal. The form for one side of the cover is placed on one end of
the form cylinder, and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>

that for the other side on the other end of the cylinder. This
ingenious combination results in the printing of one cover to every
copy of the journal issued and no more.</p>

<p>The demand for printed matter seems to increase with the ability
to furnish it, and much attention is now being directed to the
subject of color printing on the rotary system. From present
appearances, and from the enterprise displayed by the publisher, the
artist and the press maker, it would seem as though the day is not
far distant when this subject alone would furnish matter for a new
chapter in the history of the printing press.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to give in a short article even a summary of
the various kinds of machines to print newspapers of various sizes,
in black as well as in colors, weekly periodicals, magazines, books,
pamphlets, in short every class of printing, in connection with
folding, which have been evolved and perfected up to the present
time. The work still goes on, one step in advance leading to another,
until now a printer can obtain a great variety of machines to print
from the roll or fed from separate sheets, and which, especially in
the production of large numbers, economize both time and labor. Nor
is this constant advance in mechanical construction confined to the
machines themselves or the manipulation of the paper. It extends to
the manufacture of the paper and the inks, although the manufacturers
of the latter have not advanced in the same proportion as the
paper-maker, who every year produces finer paper in the roll and in
greater quantities than ever before.</p>

  <div class="captionx">DOUBLE SEXTUPLE PRESS BUILT FOR THE NEW YORK JOURNAL</div>
</div>

<p>R. Hoe &amp; Co. have now in process of construction four
mammoth printing machines, which will give a greater product and a
greater variety of products than any machines that have hitherto
been devised. They are Double Sextuple Presses and so called, but
in reality are much more than this, inasmuch as they combine the
ability to do printing in colors as well as in black. This machine is
composed, so to speak, of two separate, complete printing mechanisms,
each fed from three four-page-wide rolls of paper; the apparatus for
the gathering and folding of these webs of paper after printing being
in the centre between the two sections of the machine. The “formers”
and folders (placed back to back) enable a manipulation or gathering
of the webs which could not be readily obtained in any other way. All
these devices and methods have been patented by Hoe &amp; Co. The
following is a summary description of these new machines and what
they will accomplish. The two sections may be used separately if
desired, as independent machines.</p>

<p>Each of the two portions of the machine is composed of six pairs
of cylinders, arranged, with their axles parallel, in three tiers
of two pairs each and printing on both sides (or perfecting) three
webs of paper from separate rolls, each four pages wide. One of
the sections is also arranged so that all six sets of cylinders
will print upon a single web in colors and black, this web being
associated with the three webs from the other portion to form a
colored cover for the products, when required.</p>

<p>The rolls of paper are placed at the end of the machine&mdash;three

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>

at each end&mdash;and the two folders for each portion are placed
back to back midway in the length of the machine. The runs of
all the webs are therefore approximately the same and as short as it
is possible to have them&mdash;a matter of much importance in the
running of multiple webs.</p>

<p>Altogether there are twelve plate cylinders in the machine, each
carrying eight plates the size of a newspaper page. Either stereotype
or electrotype plates may be used. To receive the latter, which are
much thinner than stereotype plates, special base or jacket plates
are secured to the cylinders. The ink is applied to the plates by
four form rollers, after having been thoroughly distributed by
vibrating rollers and cylinders.</p>

<p>The full capacity of the machine, when printing all black, on
six rolls, is 96,000 twelve-page papers per hour, and other numbers
of pages at proportionate speeds, namely, four, six, eight and
ten-page papers, at the same speed as twelve-page; fourteen and
sixteen-page papers at 72,000 per hour; eighteen, twenty, twenty-two
and twenty-four page papers at 48,000 per hour. The three webs from
each portion of the machine are led to the top of the folders, where
they are divided along their centre line into webs two pages wide,
and then run down each of the four “formers,” by which they are
folded along their centre. They are then led through cylinders which
cut them into page lengths and give them a fold across the page to
half-page size. In this way twenty-four page papers may be obtained
at the rate of 48,000 copies per hour, by collecting two twelve-page
sections on the cylinder just before the half-page fold is made.
Another method of running twenty-four page papers is to associate the
six webs, from both portions of the machine, and run them over one
pair of “formers,” thus folding all six webs together, or insetting
them, in the first fold.</p>

<p>Lesser number of pages may be obtained by making various
combinations, the number of which is almost limitless. Angle bars

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>

are placed in the machine for transferring half-width webs of
paper from one side of the press to the other, facilitating these
combinations.</p>

<p>The maximum product of the machine when running as a color press
is 48,000 sixteen-page papers per hour, with the two outside pages
printed in four colors and black; the other pages in black only. If,
however, it is not desired to have so many colors on the outside
pages, it is possible to obtain twenty-page papers, at the rate of
48,000 per hour, with the two outside pages in two colors and black;
all the other pages in black only. Papers with any number of pages
from four to sixteen, with four colors and black on the outside
pages, the other pages in black only, can be obtained at a speed of
48,000 per hour. By running the full product of the color section of
the machine into one folder and associating therewith webs of paper
from the other section of the machine, papers with any number of
pages from eight to twenty-four, with the two outside pages and two
of the inside pages printed in four colors and black, the other pages
in black only, can be produced at a speed of 24,000 per hour.</p>

<p>The dimensions of this machine are as follows: Length, 35 feet;
height, 17 feet; width, 9 feet; the weight, about 225,000 pounds; and
the number of parts of which it is composed, approximately 50,000.</p>

<p>The last three or four years have also witnessed an immense
advance in the art of color printing. The magazine without an
elaborate color cover, or perhaps colored illustrations, is now
an exception, whereas it was the reverse not long ago. After
satisfactory experiments it was ascertained by the writer that,
with the inks properly prepared, and suitable plates to print from,
colors could be printed almost simultaneously upon the paper, without
mingling; in short that the supposed necessity, in much of the work
done, of drying the sheets after the impression of each color on the
paper, was not necessary

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>

for the production of a good quality of printing. Further experiments
also proved the mechanical possibility of obtaining most accurate
register in printing from a roll and that the number of impressions,
or colors, could be increased to advantage. These various experiments
resulted in the construction by Hoe &amp; Co. of color presses which
were almost simultaneously installed by the proprietors of the New
York “Herald” and the New York “World,” who commenced the publication
of colored supplements, upon a system which has been adopted by
the papers in most of the large cities, and which they have never
discontinued. The practicability of printing in colors has been so
fully demonstrated that color attachments are being added to very
many of the large newspaper presses throughout the country.</p>

<p>The most extensive of the color presses, and the largest printing
machine ever constructed, is the color press made by Hoe &amp; Co.
for the New York “Journal” and now used in printing portions of
the Sunday editions of that paper, although others of approximate
proportions and capacity have been made for the New York “World,”
the New York “Herald,” the Chicago “Tribune,” the Boston “Post” and
other newspapers. This machine gives as many as eleven separate
impressions, or colors, on a single copy of the paper; that is, it
will print in six colors on one side of the sheet and five on the
other, or it may be arranged to print three colors on one side and
six on the other, giving a speed of about 16,000 eight-page papers
an hour, or at every revolution of the cylinders the equivalent of
two perfect eight-page papers printed in colors. Four, six, eight,
ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, twenty, twenty-four, twenty-eight or
thirty-two-page papers may be printed on this machine, as required,
from one, two or three double-width (or four-page-wide) rolls of
paper. It will also produce magazine forms (with pages half the size
of those of the regular issue of the paper) at from 16,000 to 24,000
an hour, either 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 40 or 48 pages, delivered folded,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>

cut, and automatically wire-stitched, with all the pages printed in
colors or half-tones.</p>

<p>Such a development of the art of printing, especially in colors,
in which accurate register is not only necessary, but must be
maintained, would have seemed incredible a few years ago, but this
is now a daily occurrence and many newspaper offices produce colored
supplements in the same manner and with the same results, having
additions placed upon their quadruple, sextuple and other presses for
the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span><br />

  <div class="captionx">“COLLIER’S WEEKLY” PRESS</div>
</div>

<p>Nor has this development of colors been confined entirely to
the demands of the newspaper world. It is gradually finding its
way into the weekly periodical and the monthly magazines. It had
been considered impossible to print half-tone illustrations on
both sides of the sheet at one operation and deliver them flat,
without smutting. Not only has this difficulty been overcome, but
in the latest presses, such as used by Collier’s Weekly, the finest
half-tone work is done on a perfecting press printing on a roll of
paper. The periodical is printed in multiple pages, as required, and
delivered from the machine folded, cut apart and pasted, ready for
the binder. It is not desirable, of course, when using fine inks, to
make immediate delivery from the press; therefore the papers, after
having been perfected, folded and pasted, are left to stand for
some hours before they are distributed to the readers. Satisfactory
methods of doing this have also been devised. The capacity for
printing fine half-tone illustrations on a rotary press having thus
been demonstrated the next step is evidently the production of
colored half-tones, and the time is undoubtedly near at hand when
the monthly magazine as well as the weekly periodical will appear,
instead of in black half-tones, now so popular, with these same
illustrations printed in the most delicate manner in colors and all
delivered in perfection from rotary presses, folded in entirety, or
in signatures, ready for the binder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>It must now be evident to every experienced observer that the time
has arrived when printing upon the rotary system will in a large
measure supersede that now done upon flat-bed cylinder presses,
although the latter will always be retained for some kinds of work.
Satisfactory methods will be devised for attaching upon the cylinders
electrotype or stereotype plates of varying sizes. In addition to
this, new and improved methods are constantly being brought forward
for the transferring of type forms, photographs and illustrations
of every description, upon prepared sheets of metal, which receive
the ink and give impressions either from a raised surface, as in the
ordinary letter-press printing, or in the manner of lithographic
printing. These and other new methods of making plates will
undoubtedly lead in the future to great economy, as well as to
important improvements in the process of printing.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
